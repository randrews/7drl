Rogue-Break Coffee-Like
A 7-Day Roguelike by Ross Andrews

2013-03-08 =====================================================================

I decided, pretty much on a whim, to do the 7DRL this year. I was planning on
writing an RL anyway, so this just gives me a timeline.

RBCL is going to be a fairly minimal RL: randomly-generated levels, simple
monster AI (walk toward the player, basically), no shops or town or anything. A
few potions / scrolls for spells, and you go down as far as you can. Your score
will be the amount of gold you find, plus points for equipment, plus like 10,000
for each level beyond the first you see.

Implementation: I'm doing it in Love2D, because I already know that really well,
and I'll use free graphics from "Tile Crusader" (found it on /r/gameassets).

Schedule: I don't have a *huge* amount of time to devote to it, I can't take the
week off work or anything. So I'm hoping to get a lot done this weekend and then
work on it every night next week.

- After Saturday I hope to have a guy, walking around the screen, with it
scrolling as he moves, and a sidebar with his stats / whatever.

- Sunday I devote to level generation and graphical fanciness (corner tiles for
walls, etc).

- Mon..Wed: enemies and fighting them.

- Thurs..Fri: chests / potions / scrolls.

That's my bare-minimum schedule. If I start to miss those goals I'll start to
scale back, or declare the whole thing failed.

2013-03-09 =====================================================================

Starting development! I'm starting with the skeleton Love2D project I use, with
middleclass, LoveFrames, inspect, and a bunch of little classes I wrote (Point,
Map, List, Set, Tween, Promise, and Clock).

The first question I'm dealing with is what size to make the window. I've
settled on 1000 x 600. I want the map area to be a multiple of 40 pixels in each
direction, because that's how big the graphics tiles I'm using are. This lets me
have a 200 pixel status sidebar and the other 80% of the width as the map.

The only problem is that makes the height 15 tiles and the width 20, which means
I can't center the player on the screen because both dimensions would have to be
odd. I'll solve that by centering them horizontally anyway, and drawing two
columns of half-tiles.

================================================================================

Okay, this has been going easier than I expected. I've got a guy walking around
the map, he can't walk through walls, and the map is being drawn with graphics.
I'm going to start the status bar next, which means it's time for some actual
game design: I need to know what statuses to put on it.

We'll need health obviously, and what level you're on, and your current score. I
also want some kind of inventory or something, and a button you can click to
bring up a help screen. Messages will go somewhere else on the screen, so that's
not a big deal (a long thin thing is bad for messages).

So, level, score, health, all up top in a stack. Buttons to bring up help and
quit on the bottom in a stack. In between, inventory. Maybe inventory and skills
in an accordion view kind of thing?
